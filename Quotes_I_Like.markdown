"All Life is figured by them [the Norse] as a Tree. Igdrasil, the Ash tree of existence, has its roots deep down in the kingdoms of Hela or Death; its trunk reaches up heaven-high, spreads its boughs over the whole universe: it is the tree of existence. At the foot of it sit three “Nornas”, Fates,—past, present and future, watering its roots from the sacred well. Its “boughs”, with their buddings and disleafings? —events, things suffered, things done, catastrophes, — stretch through all lands and time. Is not every leaf a biography? Its boughs are Histories of Nations. The rustle of it is the noise of Human Existence. It grows there, the breath of human passion rustling through it… the infinite conjugation of the verb'to do.'" 	

-- Thomas Carlyle


"There are certain queer times and occasions in this stranger mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimply discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own... And, as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of life and limb, all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker.That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness; so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the _Pequod_, and the great White Whale its object."

— Herman Melville, _Moby-Dick_

"Denn von Grund aus liebt man nur sein Kind und sein Werk; und wo große Liebe zu sich selber ist, da ist sie der Schwangerschaft Wahrzeichen. Noch grünen mir meine Kinder in ihrem ersten Frühlinge, nahe beinander stehend und gemeinsam von Winden geschüttelt, die Bäume meines Gartens und besten Erdreichs. Knorrig und gekrümmt und mit biegsamer Härte soll er mir dann am Meere dastehe, ein lebendiger Leuchtturm unbesiegbaren Lebens."

— Friedrich Nietsche, _Also Sprach Zarathustra_
